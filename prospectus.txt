Victory S&P 500 Index Fund Summary
Investment Objective
The Victory S&P 500 Index Fund (the “Fund”) seeks to provide performance and income that is comparable to the S&P
500® Index (the “Index”).
Fund Fees and Expenses
The table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy, hold, and sell shares of the Fund. You may pay
other fees such as brokerage commissions and other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the
table and examples below. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your immediate family invest, or agree
to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the Victory Funds. More information about these and other discounts is
available in Investing with the Victory Funds on page 13 of the Fund's Prospectus, in Appendix A — Variations in Sales
Charge Reductions and Waivers Available Through Certain Intermediaries and from your financial intermediary.
Shareholder Fees
(paid directly from your investment)
Class A Class R Class Y
Maximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed on Purchases
(as a percentage of offering price) 2.25% None None
Maximum Deferred Sales Charge (Load)
(as a percentage of the lower of purchase or sale price) None None None
Annual Fund Operating Expenses
(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)
Management Fees 0.20% 0.20% 0.20%
Distribution and/or Service (12b-1) Fees 0.15% 0.50% 0.00%
Other Expenses 0.18% 0.17% 0.26%
Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses 0.53% 0.87% 0.46%
Example:
This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual
funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods shown and then sell or continue to
hold all of your shares at the end of those periods. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each
year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. The amounts shown reflect any fee waiver/expense
reimbursement in place through its expiration date. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these
assumptions your costs would be:
1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 10 Years
Class A $278 $391 $515 $ 875
Class R $ 89 $278 $482 $1,073
Class Y $ 47 $148 $258 $ 579
The example does not reflect sales charges (loads) on reinvested dividends and other distributions. If these sales charges
(loads) were included, your costs would be higher.

Victory S&P 500 Index Fund Summary
Portfolio Turnover:
The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A
higher portfolio turnover generally will indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares
are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Fund operating expenses or in the example,
affect the Fund’s performance. For the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 4% of the average
value of its portfolio.
Principal Investment Strategy
Victory Capital Management Inc. (“Adviser”) pursues the Fund’s objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at
least 80% of its assets in equity securities of companies in the S&P 500® Index (“Index”). The Index is an unmanaged
index of 500 U.S. publicly traded stocks common stocks selected by Standard & Poor’s from a broad range of industries.
The Index is composed primarily of stocks issued by large-capitalization companies.
To replicate the performance of the Index, the Adviser purchases and maintains all or substantially all of the securities
included in the Index, in approximately the same percentages as such securities are included in the Index. Because the
Fund seeks to track the performance of the Index, the Adviser does not actively determine the stock selection or sector
allocation. The percentage weighting of a particular security in the Index is determined by that security’s relative total
market capitalization, which is the market price per share of the security multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.
To track the Index as closely as possible, the Fund attempts to remain fully invested in stocks. The Fund normally invests
at least 95% of its net assets in the stocks of companies included in the Index. The Adviser uses futures contracts to
manage cash, accrued dividends, and other non-performing assets in an effort to minimize performance disparity between
the Fund and the Index.
Principal Risks
The Fund’s investments are subject to the following principal risks:
Equity Securities Risk — The value of the equity securities in which the Fund invests may decline in response to
developments affecting individual companies and/or general economic conditions in the United States or abroad. A
company’s earnings or dividends may not increase as expected (or may decline) because of poor management,
competitive pressures, reliance on particular suppliers or geographical regions, labor problems or shortages, corporate
restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, man-made or natural disasters, military confrontations or wars, terrorism, public
health crises, or other events, conditions, and factors. Price changes may be temporary or last for extended periods.
Passive Investment Risk/Index Risk — The Fund is designed to track the Index and is not actively managed. The Fund
will not buy or sell shares of an equity security due to current or projected performance of a security, industry, or sector,
unless that security is added to or removed, respectively, from the Index. The Fund does not, therefore, seek returns in
excess of the Index, and does not attempt to take defensive positions or hedge against potential risks unless such
defensive positions are also taken by the Index.
Tracking Error Risk — The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance
from its index. Tracking error may occur because of, among other reasons, differences between the securities and other
instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Index. This risk may be heightened during times of
increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs
fees and expenses, while the Index does not.
Sector Focus Risk — To the extent the Fund focuses in one or more sectors, such as the information technology sector,
market or economic factors impacting those sectors could have a significant effect on the value of the Fund’s investments
and could make the Fund’s performance more volatile.

Victory S&P 500 Index Fund Summary
◼ Information Technology Sector Risk — Companies in the information technology sector face intense
competition, both domestically and internationally. These companies may be smaller or newer and may have
limited product lines, markets, financial resources, or personnel. The products of companies in the information
technology sector may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new
product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates, and competition for the services of qualified
personnel. These companies may be developing or marketing new products or services for which markets are
not yet established and may never become established.
Futures Contracts Risk – The Fund's use of futures contracts exposes the Fund to leverage and tracking risks because a
small investment in futures contracts may produce large losses and futures contracts may not be perfect substitutes for
securities.
General Market Risk — Overall market risks may affect the value of the Fund. Domestic and international factors such
as political events, war, terrorism, trade disputes, inflation rates, interest rate levels, and other fiscal and monetary policy
changes; cybersecurity incidents, pandemics, and other public health crises; sanctions against a particular foreign
country, its nationals, businesses, or industries; and related geopolitical events, as well as environmental disasters such as
earthquakes, fires, and floods, or other catastrophes, may add to instability in global economies and markets generally,
and may lead to increased market volatility. Global economies and financial markets are highly interconnected, which
increases the possibility that conditions in one country or region might adversely affect issuers in another country or
region. The impact of these and other factors may be short-term or may last for extended periods.
Large Shareholder Risk — Certain large shareholders, including other funds advised by the Adviser, may from time to
time own a substantial amount of the Fund’s shares. The actions by one shareholder or multiple shareholders may have
an impact on the Fund and, therefore, indirectly on other shareholders. Shareholder purchase and redemption activity
may affect the per share amount of the Fund’s distributions of its net investment income and net realized capital gains, if
any, thereby affecting the tax burden on the Fund’s shareholders subject to federal income tax, and/or accelerate the
realization of taxable income and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its shareholders earlier than the Fund
otherwise would have. To the extent a larger shareholder is permitted to invest in the Fund, the Fund may experience
large inflows or outflows of cash from time to time. This activity could magnify these adverse effects on the Fund.
You may lose money by investing in the Fund. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its objective. An
investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any other government agency.
By itself, the Fund does not constitute a complete investment plan and should be considered a long-term investment for
investors who can afford to weather changes in the value of their investment.
Investment Performance
The bar chart and table that follow are intended to help you understand some of the risks of investing in the Fund. The
bar chart shows you how the Fund’s calendar year performance has varied over the past 10 years. The table compares the
Fund’s average annual total returns of the Fund's share classes, including applicable maximum sales charges, over the
same period to one or more broad measures of market performance. We assume reinvestment of dividends and
distributions.
Performance data for the classes varies based on differences in their fee and expense structures and reflects any expense
limitations in effect during the periods shown. The Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available on the Fund’s website at
vcm.com.

After-tax returns use the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the effect of
state and local taxes. In certain situations, the return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares may be higher
than the other return amounts. A higher after-tax return may result when a capital loss occurs upon redemption and
translates into an assumed tax deduction that benefits the shareholder. Actual after-tax returns depend on your tax
situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns shown are not relevant if you own your Fund shares through
tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. After-tax returns are shown for only
one share class. The after-tax returns for other classes will vary.

Minimum Initial Investment $2,500 None $1,000,000
Minimum Subsequent Investments $ 50 None None
For Class A shares a $1,000 minimum initial purchase amount and a $50 minimum subsequent purchase amount apply
for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), gift/transfer to minor accounts, and purchases through automatic investment
plans.
Certain broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries (such as a bank) may establish higher or lower minimum initial

You may redeem your shares on any day the Fund is open for business. Redemption requests may be made by telephone
(with prior appropriate approval) or by mail.
When you buy and redeem shares, the Fund will price your transaction at the next-determined net asset value (“NAV”)
after the Fund receives your request in good order, which means that your request contains all the required
documentation, and that all documents contain required signatures or signature guarantees from a financial institution.
Tax Information
The Fund’s distributions are taxable whether you receive them in cash, additional shares of the Fund, or you reinvest
them in shares of another Victory Fund, and will be taxed as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing
through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account. Taxes may be imposed on
withdrawals from tax-deferred arrangements.
Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
If you purchase the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its
related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create
a conflict of interest by influencing the financial intermediary and its financial advisor to recommend the Fund over
another investment. Ask your financial advisor or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
